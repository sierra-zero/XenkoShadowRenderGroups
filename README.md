# XenkoShadowRenderGroup Madness
Solve the riddle to discover endless happiness!!!

Requirement: 
1) Camera1 must render the cube and shadow, not the sphere and shadow.
2) Camera2 must render the sphere and cube, both with shadows.
3) You cannot disable the shadow on the object/model.
4) Preferably done through compositor, but any other approach is appreciated.

A camera toggle is availale using [Tab].

Good luck!
